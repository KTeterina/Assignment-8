Conclusions for Assignment 8 by Ekaterina Teterina

The first task was rather easy. I used the same logic as in the class example, but with 3 elements. The idea is pretty straight forward, so I didn't have difficulties woth this task.

The second task was more difficult because commad type() only checked the type of the particular object, it refused to check the type of elements inside a list. So I did a little of research and found command isinstance(object, classinfo) which does exactly what I need: checks if the element is of a particular type. 

The flow of my logic was the following:
1. Create a list obj with different type elements;
2. Create a variable n_string equal to 0 that will count the number of string elements in my list;
3. Create a loop where I every element i in the list obj is checked. If the element is str, then add 1 to the variable n_string;
4. Print the value n_string in the end.
